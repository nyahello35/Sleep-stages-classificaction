# Sleep-stages-classificaction
Cross-datasets sleep stage classificaction 

This matlab code is about implementing the cross-dataset sleep stage classificaction. In our experiment, we use 4 datasets: Sleep-EDF SC, Sleep-EDF ST, DREAM, and MASS-SS1. The features of EEG are extracted by scattering transform. We compare 3 different dimensional reduction method: canonical correlation analysis (CCA), subspace alignment (SA), and reduced-kernel TCA (rTCA).

Unfortunately, the inputs files are too large to upload to github.
